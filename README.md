# Derivative Calculator in Haskell

## Overview
This project implements a derivative calculator in Haskell, capable of performing minor simplifications without domain analysis. Unlike typical online derivative calculators, this project emphasizes accuracy over extensive simplification, providing more reliable outputs.

## Features
- Implements a Haskell module for symbolic differentiation.
- Includes simplification of mathematical expressions without domain analysis.
- Offers a custom-built suite of test cases for robust validation.

## Installation and Usage
Install any dependencies or prerequisites needed, then run the `calc.hs` file.

## Testing
The project includes a comprehensive test plan, ensuring reliability and correctness of the functions `eval`, `diff`, and `pretty`. QuickCheck is also utilized for additional validation.
